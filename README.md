# Famous_Paintings_Project_SQL

## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the Famous Paintings Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings/data).
By responding multiple questions using PostgreSQL queries we seek to indentify key data points and gain deeper understanding about this dataset.

## Data Sources
The Dataset used for this analysis is composed of multiple `csv` files containing information about famous paintings, museums, and more.

## Project Files
- `Questions.txt`: Contains 22 questions to be answer realted to the Database.
- `Answers.sql`: PostgreSQL Script for each query. Some of the questons have multiple answers as there are more than one way to provide an answer. Aswell, there are comments to provide more insoght into the solution process.
- `Create_tables.sql`: PostgreSQL Script to creat each of the tables to be used during this project.

## Tools
- **Excel**: Data cleaning & preparation.
- PGAdmin4: Data Analysis using **PostgreSQL** queries.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparatino phase we perform the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and Inspection.
2. Handling Missing values.
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting.
4. Data Validation and Accuracy

## Exploratory Analysis
EDA involved exploring the multiple `csv` files to asnwer the multiple questions from the `Questions.txt` file.

## Data Analysis
Include various levels of queries used to answer the questions.
- **Basic Level**: Simple queries involving selections and filtering.
- **Intermediate Level**: Queries with aggregations, joins, and conditional filtering.
- **Advanced Level**: Complex queries requiring subqueries, CTE (Common Table Expressions), Window Functions, and data manipulation.
